# My Experiences

HTML/CSS/JS:

- Rock Paper Scissors with easy+hard difficulty. I also have one with Python as a server and ability to play other people, but I couldn't find a free web hosting site that supports Python.

- A project I made for the UI course. The task was to create a mail sorting game with distractions. I went one step further.

Java:

- A project that started off out of personal interest, but I transitioned it into the 'practice final thesis' in university.
- There's an online flash game named Platform Racing 2. Using various bits of knowledge, I managed to program access to various functions that were inaccessible to common users.
- I created a bot that answers to private messages, I created a level transfering method between accounts, I managed to transform images into block data and create a level from it.
- But most importantly, I downloaded the game's whole level and user database to cheat at a monthly reoccurring event where you have to find a rare artifact hidden in a random level.
- The level would reveal in a "[level_name] by [user_name]" format (e.g. JumpMan by Player1) and letters would reveal one by one (e.g. __m_M____y_____e__).
